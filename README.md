# PyramidBox
This repo implements PyramidBox with pytorch
The paper [PyramidBox](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07737) is based on VGG16.
Here, I implements data-anchor-sampling, LFPN, max-in-out layer.
## The result on WIDER FACE Val set:

AP Easy | AP Medium | AP Hard
------------------------------
  95.3  |    94.3   |  89.0   

The trained models will be released later.
